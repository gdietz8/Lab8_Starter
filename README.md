# Lab 8 - Starter
1. I would fit the automated tests in the Recipe project development pipeline **within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed** because this option minimizes the amount of code/manual testing you have to do yourself and these tests are automatically run whenever you push new changes in your code. You also don't have to worry about forgetting to run tests if you were doing it locally first. Running them all after all development is completed is a bad idea because if there are bugs in your code it will be harder to fix them once you've already written everything and expanded your code off of those bugs.
2. **No**, you would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output.
